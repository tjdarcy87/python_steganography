Running steg.py provides a menu to the user with 3 options:
- Hide a message within an image (image path is prompted to the user)
- Retrieve a message from an image (image path is prompted to the user)
- Quit the application
  
steg.py can be passed a parameter on whether or not to use encryption (will encrypt the message using AES-GCM) prior to embedding it within the image.
